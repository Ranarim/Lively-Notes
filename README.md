Super Forge utilizies [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) a next generation frontend tool that utilizes hot module reloading to super charge your development experience. It has a custom script to enable a multi developer experience.

```
    ATLASSIAN_BASE_URL=

```

**note that APP_TITLE is what you want the app to be called in product**

4. Register the app using `npm run register`

## ‚ùî FAQ

- **Why do I need to `npm run register` instead of `forge register`?**

At the time of writing this, Forge doesn't provide a solution for a multi developer experience.
Running `npm run register` will replace certain values in the **manifest.yml** file with environment variable placholders.
Local configuration is stored in the **.env.local** which should not be commited

- **Why does Forge keep asking me to approve access while running `forge tunnel`?**

If you change scope or permissions of your app (in the manifest.yml file), you will need to grant access in that same environment **not** in tunnel mode.

- **Can I change what module this app type is?**

Yes, the Confluence macro is just a default value to get developers started.
Feel free to replace the module values with any of the existing Forge app modules
