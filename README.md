2. In a separate terminal: `npm run dev`

## ‚ùî FAQ

- **Why does Forge keep asking me to approve access while running `forge tunnel`?**

If you change scope or permissions of your app (in the manifest.yml file), you will need to grant access in that same environment **not** in tunnel mode.

- **Can I change what module this app type is?**

Yes, the Confluence macro is just a default value to get developers started.
Feel free to replace the module values with any of the existing Forge app modules.

- **How can I contribute if i'm not the app owner?**

Currently Forge is designed for single user development, which means they don't have a good story for adding contributors. To do it manually you will need to run `forge register` with a name like <app-name>-<your name> and then revert the manifest.yml file before commiting your changes.
